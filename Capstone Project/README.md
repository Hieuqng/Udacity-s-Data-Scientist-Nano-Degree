## Description <a name="description"></a>

In this project, I want to walk through the basic [Data Science process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining), especially focus on Data Preparation and Modeling. The result is then communicated through a Blog Post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@holmesdoyle/data-exploration-and-feature-importance-with-xgboost-d72985bebb2).

## Installing <a name="installation"></a>

1. Almost libraries needed to run this project provided by the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

2. [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html): can be installed by running this command in the terminal

```
pip3 install xgboost
```

## Getting Started <a name="getstarted"></a>

Clone this repository and run the ipynb file in the code directory.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The only notebook file contains every steps from data exploration, preparation to modeling and evaluation.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@holmesdoyle/data-exploration-and-feature-importance-with-xgboost-d72985bebb2).
